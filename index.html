			<p>Welcome, young one. I am Sensei Cat, here to tell you a little bit about
				Kitten Arms Race before you begin. Many l33t kitties have tried to help
				us in this long war. You must be ready to click as fast as you can if 
				you are to survive. You should be able to do this much faster than us
				kitties as you have thumbs. Remember to upgrade your kitties often as
				well. Catnip can be exchanged for more elite and well armed kitties. </p>
				<p>Good luck. Sensei Cat out. *Mic Drop*</p>
				<p>PS: Saving and Loading are currently not supported so don't accidently 
					close the window, meow.</p>
