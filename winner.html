		<h1>Congratulations</h1>
		<img src="images/cats/dance.gif" alt="Victory Dance">
		<p>You have defeated the last mighty enemy of the cat people 
			and propelled our company to the top of the Cat based 
			Security Industry. Unfortunately, you defeating that final 
			boss means there's no reason for our company to exist any
			longer so this means we're gonna have to fire you with 
			no benefits. But hey, you got that good feeling inside of
			you that you brought on world peace. Hopefully, that helps
			keep you warm in your cardboard box this winter.</p>
		<p> - Management</p>
		<p>PS: Sensei Cat says you can crash at his place until you get 
			back on your feet.</p>
